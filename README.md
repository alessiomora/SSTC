# Structured Sparse Ternary Compression (SSTC)
This repository contains the basic implementation for the simulations from the paper:  
**"Structured Sparse Ternary Compression for Convolutional Layers in Cross-Device Federated Learning"**  
by **Alessio Mora, Luca Foschini, and Paolo Bellavista"**

## Setting the environment
To run the code in this repository, i.e. to run the main.py file, you just need to have a Python 
virtual environment with TensorFlow Federated installed. 
Here the official guide to install TFF:
[Install TensorFlow Federated](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/install).  
We tested the code on Ubuntu 20.04, with Python v3.8.10 and tensorflow-federated v0.19.

## Running the simulation
Activate your virtual environment and run the following command from the fedavg directory.

`python emnist_fedavg_main.py`
